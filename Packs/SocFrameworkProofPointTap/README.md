# SOC Proofpoint TAP Integration Enhancement for Cortex XSIAM

This pack supplements the native Proofpoint TAP v2 integration within Palo Alto Networks
Cortex XSIAM. It provides SOC Framework-aligned detection rules and data normalization that
replace the default Proofpoint correlation rule, reduce alert volume to actionable signals
only, and feed enriched email threat data into the NIST IR lifecycle.

## What's Included

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Correlation Rule** | `SOC Proofpoint TAP - Threat Detected All Alerts` — unified rule covering messages delivered and clicks permitted. Fires on active/malicious threat status only. Suppression per GUID/24hr. Resolves the recipient to a canonical, unquoted email (email-first) for cross-source grouping, with an optional CIE (`socfw_identity_map`) enrichment overlay shipped commented-out and OFF by default. Populates `socfw*` fields for Foundation playbook consumption. |
| **Modeling Rule** | `SOC ProofpointTAP Modeling Rule` — maps `senderIP → xdm.source.ipv4`. All other email context (sender, recipients, subject, message-id, attachments, threat data) rides the correlation rule's `alert_fields` at `issue.*` rather than XDM (the Data Model has no valid `xdm.email.*` paths). |

## What Changed from 1.0.x

> **Important — Pack ID Change**
> This pack has a new ID (`socfw-proofpoint-tap`). The previous pack (`soc-proofpoint-tap`)
> will remain installed alongside it. This is intentional — it prevents the new pack from
> overwriting layouts and correlation rules from the old pack that may still be active.
>
> **Duplicate alert risk:** if old Proofpoint rules and the new consolidated rule are both
> enabled at the same time, every TAP detection will generate two alerts. Before enabling
> the new rule, disable all old rules. See `POST_CONFIG_README.md` Step 2 for the full list.

Version 1.3.0 consolidates and simplifies the original two-rule, two-instance architecture:

- **Single integration instance** — one `Proofpoint TAP v2` instance with `Events to fetch: All` replaces the separate Clicks Permitted and Messages Delivered instances
- **No classifier or mapper** — field normalization is handled directly in the correlation rule XQL via `alert_fields` mappings. The `Proofpoint TAP Classifier` and incoming mapper are not needed and should not be configured
- **No custom incident fields** — `proofpointtap*` custom fields replaced by `socfw*` fields read natively by `Foundation_-_Normalize_Email_V3`

## Analyst Benefits

- **Reduced alert volume** — threat status filter eliminates benign deliveries before alert creation; only `active` or `malicious` threats generate alerts
- **Cross-source case grouping** — `actor_effective_username` (recipient), `action_file_sha256` (attachment hash), `dns_query_name`, and `action_remote_ip` enable XSIAM to group related email and endpoint alerts into the same case automatically
- **NIST IR lifecycle integration** — `socfw*` fields feed `Foundation_-_Normalize_Email_V3` directly, enabling the full Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery chain without manual triage
- **Email-first identity** — the recipient is normalized to a canonical, unquoted email that matches CrowdStrike `user_name` byte-for-byte, so email and endpoint alerts for the same user group into one case. Optional CIE enrichment resolves the same identity from `socfw_identity_map` when enabled (see `POST_CONFIG_README.md` Step 5)

## Requirements

- Cortex XSIAM tenant with Proofpoint TAP v2 data flowing into `proofpoint_tap_v2_generic_alert_raw`
- SOC Optimization Framework pack (`soc-optimization-unified`) installed

---

## Installation

```bash
demisto-sdk upload -i Packs/SocFrameworkProofPointTap
```
